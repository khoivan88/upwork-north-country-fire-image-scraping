All of the images are in the 'images' folder. Within `images` folder:

- `final` contains all 'final' images ('final' in quotation mark because this is for your review first), 4148 images
- `downloads`: contains all images downloaded with the scraping codes.
- `manual_downloads`: contains all images that were manually extracted from the PDF files or just one-off image from a website
- `manually_created`: (name is a little misleading) contains all images for those items listed in `src/data/items_not_found_csv`. These images are generated from the brand logo of each item
